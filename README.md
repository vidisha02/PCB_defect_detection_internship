# PCB Defect Detection

Detecting manufacturing defects on **assembled PCBs (PCBA)** — from the imaging front-end (camera, resolution, working distance) through a full deep-learning detection pipeline (YOLO → RT-DETR → GMO-DETR).


---

## Overview

The project has two connected halves:

1. **Imaging front-end** — the optics engineering that decides whether a defect is even *physically resolvable* by the camera: defect sizes, the pixels-per-mm requirement, camera/sensor choice, working distance, depth of field, and capture strategy (full-board vs. component-level patches). This determines the ceiling on everything the detection model can achieve.

2. **Deep-learning detection** — building and training defect detectors on the annotated dataset, progressing from a YOLO baseline through RT-DETR to a from-scratch reimplementation of **GMO-DETR**, the current state of the art for PCBA defect detection.

---

## Dataset

The custom dataset consists of **~550 annotated defect images** across **12 defect classes**, plus **~1,200 defect-free (negative) images**, captured as zoomed-in views of assembled PCB components.

**12 classes:** Component Crack, Component Damage, Component Liftup, Component Missing, Component No Solder, Component Solder Dry, LED Damage, Polarity Wrong, RYB Wrong Sequence, Solder Ball, Solder Short, Tombstone.

Annotations were created in **CVAT** and exported in **COCO** format, then converted to YOLO format with a stratified (rarest-class-aware) train/val split.

## Deep-Learning Detection

### Annotation

~550 defect images annotated in **CVAT** with bounding boxes + class labels, exported as COCO.

### YOLO Baseline & Transfer Learning

- **Baseline:** YOLO11s trained on the expanded ~550-image dataset (plus negatives). Substantial improvement over an earlier ~92-image run.
- **Transfer-learning study:** tested whether pretraining on the public **SolDef_AI** solder-defect dataset transfers better than standard ImageNet/COCO initialization.
  - **Finding:** SolDef_AI pretraining **did not help** — it reduced mAP@0.5 by ~10 points, with the drop near-uniform across classes (including solder classes). The likely cause is that SolDef_AI is small and narrow, so pretraining over-specialized the backbone and displaced the broad, general-purpose features that ImageNet initialization provides.

### 8-Class Study: Resolution & Cross-Validation

Four rarest classes (≤ ~15 instances) made per-class numbers noisy, so this study restricts to the **8 well-populated classes** for a reliable benchmark.

- **8-class baseline (640px):** mAP@0.5 **0.757**, mAP@0.5:0.95 **0.524**.
- **Resolution sweep (640 / 960 / 1280px):** higher resolution **did not help** — 960px is within noise on mAP@0.5 and worse on mAP@0.5:0.95; 1280px is worse on both. **640px is the right choice.**
- **5-fold cross-validation:** mAP@0.5 **0.761 ± 0.021**, mAP@0.5:0.95 **0.500 ± 0.020**. The ± is the real measurement uncertainty, confirming the baseline is stable and that the resolution differences are noise.

### RT-DETR

RT-DETR is the first **real-time end-to-end DETR** — it removes NMS (which costs YOLO both speed and accuracy) and uses an efficient hybrid encoder (AIFI + CCFF) to stay fast.

- **Config:** `rtdetr-l` (HGNetv2 backbone), 640px, 150 epochs, batch 8, AdamW, lr 1e-4 — identical data, split and augmentation as the YOLO baseline.
- **Results (8-class):** mAP@0.5 **0.770**, mAP@0.5:0.95 **0.556**, P 0.807, R 0.749 — beats YOLO on every metric, most clearly on the stricter mAP@0.5:0.95 (tighter boxes).
- **Cost:** ~5.8 it/s training (vs YOLO's 6.5, only ~11% slower) and ~33.6 ms inference (~30 FPS) — transformer accuracy at near-YOLO cost.

### GMO-DETR (from scratch)

**GMO-DETR** is a lightweight RT-DETR variant purpose-built for PCBA defects and is the current **state of the art** on the PCBA-DET benchmark (98.27% mAP@0.5 with 39.4% fewer parameters than RT-DETR).

**The authors released no code**, so the entire architecture was **reimplemented from scratch** from the paper's equations and figures:

- **GMONet** — GhostConv stem + dual-path MambaOut (DMambaOut) backbone
- **CAFF** — context-aware feature fusion (RepNCSPELAN4 + Context Anchor Attention)
- **TAIFI** — token-statistics attention (TSSA) replacing self-attention in AIFI
- **GSConv** — group-shuffle convolutions throughout the neck

Each module was cross-checked against its original source (MambaOut, PKINet, ToST) and integrated into the Ultralytics RT-DETR framework via custom module registration and a full model definition.

- **Config:** 640px, 200 epochs, batch 8, AdamW, lr 1e-4 (matching the paper's Table 2).
- **Results (12-class):** mAP@0.5 **0.534**, mAP@0.5:0.95 **0.350** — below the published figure because the paper trains on **6,384 images** while this run used **441**. A lightweight transformer with four novel modules is highly data-hungry; the architecture is proven and trains stably, but the bottleneck is data.
